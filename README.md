# u-proxy
The only perfect IPV6/IPV4 supported simple python proxy application.

What you need to type is simple

**./u-proxy.py**

or

**./u-proxy.py [port] [accept client ip address]**

The most powerful function is conjunction with ssh like

**ssh -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8000 someone@somehost**

and you run u-proxy on somehost with

**./u-proxy 8000 127.0.0.1**

**It's safe and powerfull!**

Any pull request is welcome.
